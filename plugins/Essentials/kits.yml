# EssentialsX kit configuration.
# If no kits are defined in this file, the plugin will attempt to copy them from 'config.yml'.

# All items MUST be followed by a quantity.
# Kit names should be in lowercase and will be treated as such in permissions and costs.
# Syntax: - item[:durability] amount [enchantment:level]... [itemmeta:value]...
# For detailed information on item meta, visit https://wiki.ess3.net/wiki/Item_Meta
#
# To make a kit execute a command, add '/<command>' to the item list. Use {USERNAME} to reference the player receiving the kit.
# Use {PLAYER} to display the player's display name instead of the username.
# 'delay' refers to the cooldown between how often you can use each kit, measured in seconds. Set to -1 for a one-time kit.
#
# You can also organize kits into separate files within the 'kits' subdirectory.
# Essentials will treat all '.yml' files in the subdirectory as valid kit files and add them along with those in here.
# Each file in the 'kits' subdirectory must be formatted the same as this file.
